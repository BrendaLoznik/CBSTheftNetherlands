## Statistics Netherlands â€“ Reported Thefts App
Statistics Netherlands (CBS) provides data on a range of socially relevant topics. One of these topics is on the occurrence of different types of thefts on the municipality level.  

Using Plotly and Streamlit, I created an interactive app allowing users to gain insights in the occurrence and trend of theft on both a municipal and national level.
